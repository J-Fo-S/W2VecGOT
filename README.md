# word_vectors_game_of_thrones
This is the code for the "How to Make Word Vectors from Game of Thrones (LIVE) " Siraj Raval on Youtube

##Overview

We'll use them to the find the similarity between words, map them out in 2D space, and analyze them.

##Dependencies

run `pip install -r pip-requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies. 

##Usage

The `demo.ipynb` has my commented code. The `Thrones2vec.ipynb` has the precompiled code, so you can see what the plots look like.

##Credits

Credits for this code go to [Yuriy Guts](https://github.com/YuriyGuts/). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
